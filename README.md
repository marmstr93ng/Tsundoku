Lightweight library application

## TODO
* google_books_data unit testing

* move ISBN to class - validated, both ISBN types available as attribute
* validation with alphabet in ISBN - must be before casting
* Add error message with validation failure - wrong length, incorrect digits(check digit not correct), invalid char entry


## IDEAS
* Personal Book Report - One thing learned
* Read status
* Num books read tracking
* Books not in library but read also tracked
